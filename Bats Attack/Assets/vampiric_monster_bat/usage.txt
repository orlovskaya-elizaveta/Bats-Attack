USAGE:
1) Import package to your unity project
2) Drag one of the vampiric bats prefabs into your viewport window
3) Characters come with Animation controller which animates its Idle Animation as a default state
4) You can use your scripts or game logic to animate the character
5) For setting up your animations keep in mind:

* IDLE states are meant to be characters default state before noticing the player
  We have included one idle for character flying in the air and one idle for character standing on the ground (landed)

* You can animate attacks, gethit animation, defend, die animation etc... 
  IDLE is meant to be a default state from which your character will go into other animations
  and come back to. 

* Our animations can be divided into starting from flying idle, or starting from landed idle.
  We have included some preset animation transitions in the animation controller so its easier for you to set them up.

* DIE animations automatically transition into DEAD animation 

* locomotion (flying) and idle animations are looped

* Character has a fly cycle which should begin with transition from 
  fly-up and then end with land. (You might need to adjust characters Y
  position accordingly with your scripts)

If you would like to make your own animations, use included character rig
and export FBX into your unity project
